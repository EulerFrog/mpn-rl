# Session Summary - October 8, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on development environment configuration, code cleanup, API modernization, documentation improvements, and understanding MPN architecture fundamentals.

---

## 1. Development Environment Setup

### VSCode and Pylance Configuration

**Problem**: Red underlines appearing in VSCode due to Python interpreter and type checking issues.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Created workspace settings** (`.vscode/settings.json`):
   ```json
   {
       "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python3",
       "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["${workspaceFolder}"],
       "python.analysis.autoSearchPaths": true,
       "python.analysis.diagnosticMode": "workspace",
       "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic"
   }
   ```

2. **Updated global VSCode settings** (`~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`):
   - Changed `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode` from `"standard"` to `"off"`
   - Added `python.linting.enabled: false`
   - Added Pyright disable settings
   - Added `python.analysis.typeEvaluation.analyzeUnannotatedFunctions: false`

**Rationale**: Pylance type checking was too strict for research code, causing noise with operator type issues. Disabled type checking while maintaining intellisense features.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `.vscode/settings.json` - Created
- `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json` - Modified

## 2. Training Code Cleanup

### Removed Periodic GIF Renderer

**Changes**:
1. **Removed command-line argument**: `--render-freq-mins` from train subparser
2. **Removed import**: `PeriodicGIFRenderer` from render_utils import
3. **Removed environment render mode logic**: Changed `render_mode='rgb_array' if args.render_freq_mins > 0 else None` to `render_mode=None`
4. **Removed GIF renderer initialization** (lines 138-149 previously)
5. **Removed periodic rendering call**: `gif_renderer.maybe_render(episode)` from training loop
6. **Updated resume command**: Removed render mode logic

**Rationale**: Periodic GIF rendering during training was not being used. Rendering can still be done post-training via the `render` command.

**Files Modified**:
- `main.py` - Removed periodic GIF renderer functionality

---

## 3. Gymnasium API Modernization

### Removed Backward Compatibility Code

**Problem**: Code had conditional logic to support both old (4-tuple) and new (5-tuple) Gymnasium API:
```python
if len(step_result) == 5:
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = step_result
    done = terminated or truncated
else:
    obs, reward, done, _ = step_result
```

**Solution**: Standardized to new Gymnasium API (>= 0.26) across all files:
```python
obs, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
done = terminated or truncated
```

**Files Modified**:
- `main.py` - 2 occurrences (train loop, evaluate loop)
- `visualize.py` - 1 occurrence
- `render_utils.py` - 2 occurrences
- `pca_analysis.py` - 1 occurrence

**Rationale**: Project requires Gymnasium >= 0.29.0 (per pyproject.toml), so backward compatibility is unnecessary.

---

## 4. Training Output Improvements

### Added Algorithm Specification

**Change**: Added algorithm identification to training output:
```python
print(f"Algorithm: DQN (Deep Q-Network)")
```

**Location**: `main.py:104`

**Rationale**: Makes it clear which RL algorithm is being used, helpful when expanding to multiple algorithms.

---

## 5. Documentation and References

### Created BibTeX References File

**Created**: `references.bib` with main citations:
1. **Aitken & Mihalas (2023)**: Neural population dynamics of computing with synaptic modulations (eLife)
2. **Mnih et al. (2013)**: Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (arXiv)
3. **Sutton & Barto (2018)**: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd edition, MIT Press)

### Created Reading List

**Created**: `reading_list.md` with future reading organized by topic:
- DQN Extensions (Nature 2015, Double DQN)
- Recurrent Networks in RL (DRQN)
- Hebbian Learning & Differentiable Plasticity
- Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity
- Meta-Learning & Fast Adaptation
- Experience Replay
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Working Memory (Neuroscience)
- Gymnasium Framework

**Rationale**: Separate active citations from papers to explore later. Keeps references.bib focused on what's actually being cited.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `references.bib` - Created
- `reading_list.md` - Created
- `README.md` - Modified citation section

## 6. Technical Deep Dive: MPN vs RNN

### Key Insights on MPN Backpropagation

**M Matrix is NOT Trained**:
- M matrix updated via Hebbian plasticity rule during forward pass only:
  ```python
  M_new = lambda_decay * M + eta * torch.bmm(h.unsqueeze(2), x.unsqueeze(1))
  ```
- No gradients flow through M matrix updates
- M acts as "fast weights" or short-term memory

**What Gets Trained**:
- `W` (long-term synaptic weights): `nn.Parameter` - trained via backprop
- `b` (bias term): `nn.Parameter` - trained via backprop
- `eta` and `lambda_decay`: Fixed hyperparameters, not learned

### MPN vs RNN Comparison

**RNN (LSTM/GRU)**:
- Recurrent connections: `h_t = f(W_hh @ h_{t-1}, W_xh @ x_t)`
- Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
- Vanishing/exploding gradient problem
- All weights (including recurrent) trained via backprop

**MPN**:
- No recurrent connections in W (input-to-hidden only)
- M matrix modulates W multiplicatively: `h_t = activation(b + (W * (M_t + 1)) @ x_t)`
- M updated via local Hebbian rule (no BPTT needed)
- Backprop only updates W within each timestep
- No vanishing gradient problem across time

**Two-Timescale Learning**:
- Fast: M accumulates information within episode (Hebbian, local)
- Slow: W learns across episodes (backprop, global)
- Biologically inspired: short-term plasticity + long-term potentiation

### Double DQN Implementation Clarification

**Discovered**: Training loop DOES use Double DQN, just not the `DoubleMPNDQN` wrapper class.

**Implementation** (in `model_utils.py:compute_td_loss`):
```python
# Select action with online network
next_q_online, _ = dqn(next_obs, next_states)
next_actions = next_q_online.argmax(dim=1)

# Evaluate action with target network
next_q_target, _ = target_dqn(next_obs, next_states)
next_q = next_q_target.gather(1, next_actions.unsqueeze(1)).squeeze(1)
```

**Current approach**: Manual management of online + target networks with hard updates every 10 episodes

**DoubleMPNDQN class**: Convenience wrapper providing soft update (Polyak averaging) option - available but not currently used

---

## 7. Training Visualization Discussion

### TrainingVisualizer Explained

**Purpose**: Tracks and plots training metrics during/after training

**Activation**: Only created when `--plot-training` flag is used

**Metrics Tracked** (default):
- episode_reward
- episode_length
- loss
- epsilon

**Workflow**:
1. `viz.update()` - Store metrics after each episode
2. `viz.plot()` - Generate multi-panel plot at end of training
3. Saves to `experiments/{name}/plots/training_curves.png`

**Plot Features**:
- Raw values (transparent line)
- 10-episode moving average (solid line)
- Grid for readability

## 8. Environment Sampling Performance

### CPU vs GPU for Sampling

**Discussion**: For single environment sampling in Gym/Gymnasium:

**CPU is better because**:
1. Environment logic runs on CPU only (no GPU acceleration)
2. GPU transfer overhead > computation savings for single observations
3. Current code optimizes by storing replay buffer on CPU, only moving batches to GPU for training

**GPU helps when**:
- Vectorized environments (100+ parallel)
- Large models where computation > transfer cost
- Image observations with CNN encoders

**Current implementation is optimal**: Sample on CPU, batch training on GPU

---

## 9. Future Planning: Multi-Environment Support

### Discussion Started (Paused for Later)

**Motivation**: User wants to explore adding more environments beyond CartPole to test MPN-DQN generalization and performance across different tasks.

### Key Design Questions

#### 1. Environment Types & Action Spaces

**Question**: Which environments are you targeting?
- Classic control: Acrobot, MountainCar, LunarLander, Pendulum
- Atari games: Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders (image-based)
- Robotics: MuJoCo environments (continuous control)

**Question**: Do you need continuous action spaces?
- **Current limitation**: DQN only supports discrete actions
- **Continuous actions require**: Policy gradient methods (PPO, SAC, DDPG, TD3)
- **Consideration**: Would need major architecture changes or new algorithm implementations

**Implications**:
- Stick to discrete actions → Can reuse existing DQN infrastructure
- Add continuous actions → Need to implement policy gradient algorithms with MPN

#### 2. Observation Types & Input Processing

**Question**: Vector observations only or also image observations?

**Current state**: CartPole uses 4D vector observations
- Processed directly through MPN layer
- Simple and fast

**Image observations** (e.g., Atari 84x84 RGB):
- Would need CNN encoder before MPN
- Architecture: `CNN → flatten → MPN → Q-head`
- More complex preprocessing (frame stacking, grayscale conversion, normalization)

**Question**: Do different environments need different preprocessing?
- Normalization schemes (CartPole vs LunarLander ranges differ)
- Frame stacking for partial observability (Atari)
- Action repeat and frame skip

#### 3. Architecture Design Approaches

**Option A: Single Unified Architecture**
```python
class UnifiedMPNDQN:
    def __init__(self, obs_type='vector', obs_dim=None, img_shape=None, ...):
        if obs_type == 'vector':
            self.encoder = nn.Identity()
        elif obs_type == 'image':
            self.encoder = CNNEncoder(img_shape)

        self.mpn = MPN(...)
        self.q_head = nn.Linear(...)
```

**Pros**:
- Single codebase
- Environment-specific wrappers handle differences

**Cons**:
- Can become messy with many conditionals
- Hard to extend to very different architectures

**Option B: Modular Encoder System**
```
Vector Encoder →
                 → MPN → Task Head (DQN/Actor-Critic)
Image Encoder  →
```

**Pros**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to add new encoder types
- Reusable components

**Cons**:
- More files/classes to manage
- Need clear interfaces

**Option C: Environment Registry**
```python
ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGS = {
    'CartPole-v1': {
        'encoder': 'vector',
        'obs_dim': 4,
        'action_dim': 2,
        'hidden_dim': 64,
        'eta': 0.05,
        'lambda_decay': 0.9,
        ...
    },
    'LunarLander-v2': {
        'encoder': 'vector',
        'obs_dim': 8,
        'action_dim': 4,
        'hidden_dim': 128,
        ...
    },
    'Pong-v5': {
        'encoder': 'cnn',
        'img_shape': (84, 84, 3),
        'action_dim': 6,
        ...
    }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Auto-configuration from environment name
- Easy to share hyperparameters
- Reproducible experiments

**Cons**:
- Need to maintain config database
- Less flexible for experimentation

#### 4. Code Organization Options

**Option A: Keep in main.py**
- Add environment-specific configs as dictionaries
- Handle differences with if/else branches

**Pros**: Simple, everything in one place
**Cons**: File gets very large, hard to maintain

**Option B: Separate environment modules**
```
envs/
├── __init__.py
├── cartpole.py
├── atari.py
├── mujoco.py
└── base.py  # Base environment wrapper
```

**Pros**: Modular, clean separation
**Cons**: More files to navigate

**Option C: Config files (YAML/JSON)**
```
configs/
├── cartpole.yaml
├── lunarlander.yaml
└── atari_pong.yaml
```

**Pros**: Easy to version control, share, and modify
**Cons**: Another system to maintain

#### 5. Experiment Management

**Question**: How to organize experiments across environments?

**Option A: Flat structure**
```
experiments/
├── cartpole-exp1/
├── cartpole-exp2/
├── lunarlander-exp1/
└── pong-exp1/
```

**Option B: Hierarchical structure**
```
experiments/
├── CartPole-v1/
│   ├── exp1/
│   └── exp2/
├── LunarLander-v2/
│   └── exp1/
└── Pong-v5/
    └── exp1/
```

**Question**: Environment-specific hyperparameter presets or always manual?
- Presets: Quick to start, less flexible
- Manual: Full control, more typing
- Hybrid: Presets with override options (best of both worlds)

### Design Considerations Summary

**Current Architecture Limitations**:
1. Only discrete action spaces (DQN-based)
2. Only vector observations (no CNN encoder)
3. Single environment hardcoded patterns (CartPole assumptions in some places)

**Architecture Extension Requirements**:
1. **Encoder abstraction**: Support both vector and image inputs
2. **Environment wrappers**: Normalize observations, handle different APIs
3. **Config system**: Store environment-specific hyperparameters
4. **Flexible action spaces**: At minimum support different discrete action dimensions

**Recommended Approach** (to discuss):
1. Start with **modular encoder system** (Option B from Architecture Design)
2. Use **environment registry** with YAML configs for hyperparameters
3. Implement **hierarchical experiment structure** organized by environment
4. Keep algorithm implementations separate (DQN, PPO, etc.) for clarity

**Next Implementation Steps** (when resumed):
1. Create base environment wrapper class
2. Implement vector encoder (essentially pass-through)
3. Add LunarLander-v2 as second test environment
4. Create config system for hyperparameters
5. Update main.py to use environment registry
6. Test generalization across both environments

### Open Questions for User

1. **Primary goal**: Quick testing on classic control, or building toward Atari/robotics?
2. **Timeline**: Quick prototyping or robust framework?
3. **Scope**: Discrete actions only (simpler) or also continuous (more complex)?
4. **Environments of interest**: Specific tasks in mind?

**Status**: Discussion paused to save session progress. Will resume next session.
