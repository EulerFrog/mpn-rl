# Implementation Summary: NeuroGym Integration with Trial-Based Replay

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete

---

## Overview

Successfully integrated NeuroGym environments into the MPN-RL library using **trial-based replay** to solve the "stale state" problem for recurrent networks. This allows training MPN-DQN agents on cognitive neuroscience tasks that require temporal memory.

---

## Components Implemented

### 1. TrialReplayBuffer (`model_utils.py`)

**Lines**: 60-117

```python
class TrialReplayBuffer:
    """Replay buffer for storing complete trial sequences."""
```

**Features**:
- Stores complete trial sequences (100-800 timesteps) instead of individual transitions
- Samples random trials for training
- Handles variable-length sequences efficiently
- Capacity measured in number of trials (not timesteps)

**Key Methods**:
- `push_trial(obs_list, action_list, reward_list, done_list)` - Add complete trial
- `sample(batch_size)` - Sample random trials
- `__len__()` - Number of trials in buffer

### 2. compute_td_loss_trial() (`model_utils.py`)

**Lines**: 160-250

```python
def compute_td_loss_trial(dqn, target_dqn, trial_batch, gamma=0.99, device='cpu'):
    """Compute TD loss over complete trial sequences."""
```

**Features**:
- Replays trials from scratch with fresh MPN states
- Uses Double DQN for target computation
- Accumulates loss over all timesteps in batch
- Preserves temporal coherence by regenerating states with current network

**Algorithm**:
1. For each trial in batch:
   - Initialize fresh MPN state
   - Forward pass through entire trial
   - Compute TD targets using Double DQN
   - Accumulate smooth L1 loss over all timesteps
2. Return average loss

### 3. NeuroGymWrapper (`neurogym_wrapper.py`)

**Lines**: 1-226 (new file)

```python
class NeuroGymWrapper(gym.Wrapper):
    """Wrapper for NeuroGym environments to make them Gymnasium-compatible."""
```

**Features**:
- Flattens structured observations (dict → vector)
- Tracks trial boundaries via `info['new_trial']`
- Provides Gymnasium-compatible interface
- Helper function `make_neurogym_env()` for easy creation

**Key Methods**:
- `reset()` - Reset environment, mark trial start
- `step(action)` - Take step, extract trial info
- `_flatten(obs)` - Flatten observations
- `_extract_trial_info(info)` - Extract trial boundaries

### 4. train_neurogym Command (`main.py`)

**Lines**: 264-469 (new function)

```python
def train_neurogym(args):
    """Train MPN-DQN on NeuroGym environment with trial-based replay."""
```

**Features**:
- Trial-based collection and training
- Resets MPN state at trial boundaries
- Trains when buffer has enough trials
- Uses epsilon-greedy exploration adapted for trials

**Training Loop**:
1. Collect complete trials (until `info['new_trial']` or `done`)
2. Push complete trial to buffer
3. Reset MPN state for new trial
4. Train on batch of trials using `compute_td_loss_trial()`
5. Update target network periodically

### 5. CLI Integration (`main.py`)

**Lines**: 1053-1075 (argument parser)

**Command**:
```bash
python main.py train-neurogym --env-name ContextDecisionMaking-v0 --num-episodes 1000
```

**Default Hyperparameters** (tuned for NeuroGym):
- `hidden_dim=128` (larger for memory tasks)
- `eta=0.1` (higher Hebbian learning rate)
- `lambda_decay=0.95` (stronger memory retention)
- `epsilon_start=0.3` (lower initial exploration)
- `trial_batch_size=4` (fewer trials per batch due to length)
- `buffer_size=500` (trials, not timesteps)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Trial-Based Replay?

**Problem**: Standard DQN replay breaks for recurrent networks
- Random sampling of transitions uses "stale" MPN states
- States were computed by old network parameters
- Temporal coherence broken

**Solution**: Replay trials from scratch
- Store complete trial sequences (not individual transitions)
- Regenerate MPN states using current network during replay
- Preserves temporal coherence
- Natural fit for NeuroGym's trial structure

### Comparison to Alternatives

| Approach | Memory | Complexity | Temporal Coherence |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Standard Replay** | Low | Simple | ❌ Broken |
| **SB3 State Storage** | High | Complex | ✅ Preserved |
| **Trial-Based Replay** (Ours) | Medium | Simple | ✅ Preserved |

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Simpler than SB3's state storage approach
- ✅ Always uses fresh states (more robust)
- ✅ Natural for NeuroGym (trials are the fundamental unit)
- ✅ Handles sparse rewards naturally (full trial context)

## Target Environments

Tested on:
1. **ContextDecisionMaking-v0** ✅
   - Context-dependent integration
   - Similar to MPN paper task
   - 7-dim observation space, 3 actions

Ready for:
2. **DelayMatchSample-v0**
   - Working memory across delay
3. **PerceptualDecisionMaking-v0**
   - Evidence integration over time

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run full training on ContextDecisionMaking-v0 (1000+ episodes)
2. Evaluate performance and compare to baseline
3. Test on DelayMatchSample-v0 and PerceptualDecisionMaking-v0

### Future Enhancements
1. **Multi-trial episodes**: Allow MPN state to persist across trials (meta-learning)
2. **Sequence subsampling**: Train on subsequences for long trials
3. **Gradient checkpointing**: Reduce memory for very long trials
4. **Task-specific analysis**: Add analysis tools for cognitive tasks
5. **Structured observations**: Support dict observations directly

---

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Trial-based replay uses more memory than transition-based
- With 500 trials × 200 timesteps avg = ~100k timesteps stored
- Comparable to standard buffer of 100k transitions
- Observations stored on CPU to save GPU memory

### Computation
- Forward passes through entire trials during training
- Approximately 4x slower than transition-based (for trial_batch_size=4)
- Trade-off for temporal coherence
- Can be optimized with gradient checkpointing
