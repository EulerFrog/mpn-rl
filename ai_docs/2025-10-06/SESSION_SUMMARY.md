# Session Summary - October 6, 2025

## Objective
Implement PCA analysis tools for MPN-DQN agents to analyze hidden state and M matrix dynamics, inspired by methodology from the MPN paper (eLife-83035).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Analysis Module
**File**: `pca_analysis.py` (383 lines)

**Classes**:
- `HiddenStateCollector`: Collects hidden states, M matrices, observations, actions, rewards during episode rollouts
- `MPNPCAAnalyzer`: Performs PCA analysis on collected data

**Functions**:
- `participation_ratio()`: Computes effective dimensionality metric
- `collect_episodes()`: Runs episodes with trained agent and collects data
- `plot_trajectories_2d()`: Creates 2D trajectory visualizations in PC space
- `get_cartpole_colors()`: Extracts state features from CartPole observations for coloring

**Built-in testing**: Module includes test suite at bottom, verified working

### 2. CLI Integration
**File**: `main.py` (modified)

**Added**:
- `analyze_agent()` function (~140 lines): Main analysis pipeline
- New `analyze` subcommand with argument parsing
- Integration with existing ExperimentManager infrastructure

**Command**:
```bash
python3 main.py analyze --experiment-name <name> [options]
```

### 3. Documentation
**Location**: `ai_docs/`

**Files Created**:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md`: Technical implementation details
- `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`: Command-line usage examples and scripts
- `RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md`: Potential research questions (hypotheses, not conclusions)

## Design Decisions

### Methodology
- **PCA Approach**: Pool all timesteps across all episodes, fit single PCA (follows MPN paper)
- **Data Collection**: Greedy evaluation (epsilon=0) on trained checkpoints
- **Visualization**: 2D projections in three PC pairs: (PC0,PC1), (PC0,PC2), (PC1,PC2)

### CartPole Implementation
- Hardcoded support for CartPole-v1 with 4 state features
- Flexible coloring by feature index (0: position, 1: velocity, 2: angle, 3: angular velocity)
- Extensible design allows adding other environments

### Output Structure
Results saved to: `experiments/<experiment-name>/analysis/`
- `pca_variance.png`: Explained variance bar charts with participation ratios
- `trajectories_hidden.png`: Hidden state trajectories in PC space
- `trajectories_M.png`: M matrix trajectories in PC space

## Testing and Validation

### Module Tests
```bash
$ python3 pca_analysis.py
# All tests passed
```

### CLI Tests
```bash
$ python3 main.py analyze --help
# Help text displayed correctly
```

### Available Experiments
Located in `experiments/`:
- `long-run-5k`: Has checkpoints at 500, 1000, 1500 episodes + best_model.pt
- `happy-cobra`: Has checkpoint_50.pt and final_model.pt
- `test-experiment`: Status unknown

## What Has NOT Been Done

### No Data Collection Yet
- ❌ No PCA analysis has been run
- ❌ No results generated
- ❌ No plots created
- ❌ No participation ratios measured

### No Analysis Yet
- ❌ No conclusions about dimensionality
- ❌ No conclusions about trajectory structure
- ❌ No findings documented

### Future Work
- User will create separate `docs/` folder for ground-truth documentation
- User will document experimental findings separately
- Implementation is complete and ready for data collection

## Key Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. Load checkpoint → Run episodes → Collect (hidden, M, obs, actions, rewards)
2. Pool timesteps across episodes
3. Fit PCA on pooled data
4. Transform individual episodes to PC space
5. Visualize with state feature coloring

### Data Dimensions
- Hidden states: `[n_episodes, T, hidden_dim]` → pooled → `[total_T, hidden_dim]`
- M matrices: `[n_episodes, T, hidden_dim, obs_dim]` → flattened → `[total_T, hidden_dim*obs_dim]`

### Participation Ratio
Formula: `PR = (Σλᵢ)² / Σλᵢ²`
- Quantifies effective dimensionality
- Computed from PCA explained variance
- Range: 1 (all variance in 1 PC) to N (uniform across N PCs)

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run first analysis:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py analyze --experiment-name long-run-5k
   ```

2. Examine outputs in `experiments/long-run-5k/analysis/`

3. Document findings (separately from this AI documentation)

### Exploration
- Try different color features (0-3 for CartPole)
- Compare different checkpoints (training progression)
- Vary number of episodes and components
- Compare different experiments

## Dependencies
All required packages already installed:
- numpy, torch, matplotlib, sklearn, gymnasium

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Implementation is complete and tested
- No assumptions made about results
- All documentation in `ai_docs/` is technical reference only
- User will maintain separate `docs/` for validated findings
- Code is modular and extensible for future additions
